# SRAM
As part of my journey into VLSI Design, I, Harsh Pawar, have been working on 
developing and simulating a 4x4 SRAM module. This project provided an excellent 
opportunity to delve into the fundamentals of digital systems design, specifically focusing 
on Register Transfer Level (RTL) coding and waveform analysis. It was a great learning 
experience to understand how digital systems like SRAMs operate at a hardware level.
